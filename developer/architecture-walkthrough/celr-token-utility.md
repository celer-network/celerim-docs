# CELR Token Utility

### Network Value Accrual and Fees <a href="#network-value-accrual-and-fees" id="network-value-accrual-and-fees"></a>

It is obvious that CELR token stakers and validators in the SGN are indispensable in the smooth operation of Celer IM, as explained in both of the above models.&#x20;

As such, users of Celer IM are required to pay fees to the SGN in return for its services of reaching consensus and storing attestations of the source chain messages, as well as the fund transfer. This is very much like a fee being paid for any other PoS blockchain validators. These fees are distributed to the CELR stakers corresponding to the SGN nodes that generate the block.&#x20;
